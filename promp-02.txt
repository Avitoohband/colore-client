Now build out the UI and logic for the local-only AI storytelling game.

Requirements:
✅ Use Zustand for game state:
  - players: array of { id, name }
  - currentTurn: number
  - storyLog: array of { sender, content, type: 'story' }
  - chatLog: array of { sender, content, type: 'chat' }
  - actions: addPlayer, addStoryMessage, addChatMessage, nextTurn

UI Components:
- <TurnIndicator /> — shows which player's turn it is
- <StoryLog /> — shows full story (AI + player messages)
- <PlayerChat /> — shows separate chat between players (not sent to AI)
- <PlayerInput /> — only the current player sees the AI input box
- <ChatInput /> — for player-only chat (always visible)

Layout:
- Top: game title + turn indicator
- Center-left: story log (scrollable)
- Center-right: player chat
- Bottom: input areas (story input if it's your turn, chat input always)

No backend, no API calls yet — use dummy AI responses for now.
Use Tailwind CSS to style everything simply but cleanly.
Make layout responsive (mobile/tablet compatible).
