Create a local-only, browser-based storytelling game using Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and Zustand.

🧩 Game Description:
- Multiplayer on same device (local play only)
- Players take turns typing actions into a chat to co-create a story
- An AI (e.g., Hugging Face API) generates the next part of the story based on input
- The game manages player turns, logs story messages and private player chat

📁 Folder structure:
- /app/page.tsx — main game layout
- /components/PlayerInput.tsx — input field shown only to current player
- /components/StoryLog.tsx — displays AI and player story messages
- /components/PlayerChat.tsx — separate chat between players not seen by AI
- /components/TurnIndicator.tsx — displays current player's name
- /store/gameStore.ts — Zustand store to manage game state

📦 Zustand state should include:
- players: array of { id, name }
- currentTurn: number (index of current player)
- storyLog: array of { sender, content, type: 'story' }
- chatLog: array of { sender, content, type: 'chat' }
- actions: addPlayer, addStoryMessage, addChatMessage, nextTurn

💡 Initial UI:
- Turn indicator at top
- Story log in center scrollable panel
- Input field (story) visible only to current player
- Separate chat input + panel for player-only messages
- No backend, no login, no online functionality
